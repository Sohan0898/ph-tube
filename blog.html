          1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span>var, let, and const
          are three different variable declaration keywords in JavaScript, each
          with its own scope and behavior.They were introduced to manage
          variable declarations and scoping in a more structured way.
          Let's discuss the scope of each of these keywords: <br />
          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">1. var Scope:</span>
          Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped,
          depending on whether they are declared inside a function or in the
          global scope. If a variable is declared using var within a function,
          it is accessible within that function and any nested functions.
          However, variables declared with var outside of any function block are
          globally scoped and accessible throughout the entire JavaScript
          program. var variables are subject to hoisting, which means they are
          moved to the top of their scope during compilation. This can lead to
          unexpected behavior if not understood properly.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">2. let Scope:</span> Variables
          declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are limited in scope
          to the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. Block
          scope includes loops, conditionals, and any other block-like
          structure. Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of
          their scope, which can prevent some of the unexpected
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">3. const Scope:</span> Variables
          declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let. However,
          const variables cannot be reassigned after they are assigned a value.
          The value they hold is immutable, but it's important to note that for
          complex data types like objects and arrays, the values they point to
          can still be modified. Like let, const variables are not hoisted and
          exist only within the block where they are defined. behavior
          associated with var.

          2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span>In JavaScript, both
          null and undefined represent the absence of a value, but they are used
          in slightly different contexts. Let's explore the use cases of each:
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">1. null:</span>
          null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object
          value or a deliberate assignment of "no value." It is often used to
          explicitly indicate that a variable should hold no value or that a
          value is missing. It can be assigned to variables to indicate that
          they have no valid object or value assigned to them.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">2. undefined:</span>

          undefined indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been
          assigned any value. It is the default value for uninitialized
          variables. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its
          value is automatically set to undefined. Functions that do not
          explicitly return a value also return undefined.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's important to note that while both null and undefined can indicate the absence of a value, they are not interchangeable in all situations. JavaScript treats them as distinct values, and their use cases have subtle differences.

          3. What do you mean by REST API?
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
            <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span> A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a way for software applications to communicate over the internet. It follows a set of rules that make interactions between clients (like apps or websites) and servers (where data is stored) consistent and efficient. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on resources (data entities) identified by unique URLs. This approach allows different software systems to exchange data in a structured and scalable manner.
