          1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span> var, let, and const
          are three different variable declaration keywords in JavaScript, each
          with its own scope and behavior. <br />

          <span class="underline font-semibold">1. var Scope:</span>
          When using 'var' in JavaScript, variables can be function-scoped or
          globally scoped. Declaring 'var' inside a function limits its
          accessibility to that function and its nested functions. However,
          'var' variables are subject to hoisting and can cause unexpected
          behavior. It's best to use 'let' or 'const' instead of 'var' to avoid
          any confusion or bugs in your code.

          <br />
          <span class="underline font-semibold">2. let Scope:</span> let
          variables are block-scoped, only accessible within the block they're
          defined. Unlike var, they're not hoisted to the top of their scope,
          preventing unexpected errors.
          <br />

          <span class="underline font-semibold">3. const Scope:</span> Const
          variables are block-scoped, like let, and their assigned value cannot
          be changed. They are not hoisted and only exist in the block where
          they are defined. For complex data types like objects and arrays, the
          values they point to can still be modified.
        </p>

          2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span>Null and undefined in
          JavaScript represent the absence of value but are used differently.
          <br />

          <span class="underline font-semibold">1. null:</span>
          null is a value used to indicate the absence of any object or "no
          value" assigned to a variable, often showing missing values. It can be
          assigned to signify the lack of any valid object or value.
          <br />

          <span class="underline font-semibold">2. undefined:</span> a variable
          is undefined when it is declared but not assigned a value. This is the
          default value for uninitialized variables and for functions that do
          not explicitly return a value.
          <br />

          It is important to note that even though both null and undefined
          denote the lack of a value, they are not always interchangeable.

          3. What do you mean by REST API?
        </h1>
        <p class="px-4">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Ans : </span> A REST API allows
          software applications to communicate over the Internet. It follows
          rules that make the client and server interaction consistent and
          efficient. <br />
          REST API uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
          to perform actions on resources identified by unique URLs. This method
          allows different software systems to exchange data in a structured and
          organised manner.
